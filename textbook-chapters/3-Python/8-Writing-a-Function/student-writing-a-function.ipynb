    "Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of Python programs.  Programs can range from just a handful of lines of code to literally millions of lines of code.  We manage the complexity of data and of problems that we want to solve by \"decomposing them\" (breaking them down) into smaller pieces.  The programs that we design to work with these data and solve problems are similarly decomposed into small functions - each function solving just one of the smaller tasks that make up the problem at hand.\n",

    "Functions also help to avoid duplication of code and can therefore make programs smaller and easier to understand. For example, you may need to perform identical mathematical operations on multiple sets of inputs. You could write these lines multiple times in your program, but this is prone to errors. If you made an error when writing this code, it's likely that the error would be copied into multiple parts of your program. Instead, it's better to define a function that can complete the operation and then call the function each time you need to perform that operation."
