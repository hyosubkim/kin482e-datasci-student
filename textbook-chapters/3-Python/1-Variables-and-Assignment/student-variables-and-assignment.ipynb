Python PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) (PEPs are the \"Python Enhancement Proposals\" that provide standards for the language) specifies that regular variables \"should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability\". \n",

As well, if your variable name is more than one word (such as `first_name`), you should use underscores to separate the words. This naming convention is called **snake case**.\n",
