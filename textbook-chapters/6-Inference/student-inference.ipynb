    "# Statistical inference\n",
    "\n",
    "*This chapter has been adapted from [Data Science: A First Introduction (Python Edition)](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/inference.html), by Trevor Campbell, Tiffany Timbers, Melissa Lee, Lindsey Heagy, and Joel Ostblom of UBC.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical data analysis task in practice is to draw conclusions about some\n",
    "unknown aspect of a population of interest based on observed data sampled from\n",
    "that population; we typically do not get data on the *entire* population.  Data\n",
    "analysis questions regarding how summaries, patterns, trends, or relationships\n",
    "in a data set extend to the wider population are called *inferential\n",
    "questions*. This chapter will start with the fundamental ideas of sampling from\n",
    "populations and then introduce two common techniques in statistical inference:\n",
    "*point estimation* and *interval estimation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe real-world examples of questions that can be answered with statistical inference.\n",
    "* Define common population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion, standard deviation) that are often estimated using sampled data, and estimate these from a sample.\n",
    "* Define the following statistical sampling terms (population, sample, population parameter, point estimate, sampling distribution).\n",
    "* Explain the difference between a population parameter and a sample point estimate.\n",
    "* Use Python to draw random samples from a finite population.\n",
    "* Use Python to create a sampling distribution from a finite population.\n",
    "* Describe how sample size influences the sampling distribution.\n",
    "* Define bootstrapping.\n",
    "* Use Python to create a bootstrap distribution to approximate a sampling distribution.\n",
    "* Contrast the bootstrap and sampling distributions."

    "## Why do we need sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "We often need to understand how quantities we observe in a subset\n",
    "of data relate to the same quantities in the broader population. For example, suppose a\n",
    "retailer is considering selling iPhone accessories, and they want to estimate\n",
    "how big the market might be. Additionally, they want to strategize how they can\n",
    "market their products on North American college and university campuses. This\n",
    "retailer might formulate the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What proportion of all undergraduate students in North America own an iPhone?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above question, we are interested in making a conclusion about *all*\n",
    "undergraduate students in North America; this is referred to as the **population**. In\n",
    "general, the population is the complete collection of individuals or cases we\n",
    "are interested in studying.  Further, in the above question, we are interested\n",
    "in computing a quantity&mdash;the proportion of iPhone owners&mdash;based on\n",
    "the entire population. This proportion is referred to as a **population parameter**. In\n",
    "general, a population parameter is a numerical characteristic of the entire\n",
    "population. To compute this number in the example above, we would need to ask\n",
    "every single undergraduate in North America whether they own an iPhone. In\n",
    "practice, directly computing population parameters is often time-consuming and\n",
    "costly, and sometimes impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more practical approach would be to make measurements from a **sample**, i.e., a\n",
    "subset of individuals collected from the population. We can then compute a\n",
    "**sample estimate**&mdash;a numerical characteristic of the sample&mdash;that\n",
    "estimates the population parameter. For example, suppose we randomly selected\n",
    "ten undergraduate students across North America (the sample) and computed the\n",
    "proportion of those students who own an iPhone (the sample estimate). In that\n",
    "case, we might suspect that proportion is a reasonable estimate of the\n",
    "proportion of students who own an iPhone in the entire population.\n",
    "The figure below illustrates this process.\n",
    "In general, the process of using a sample to make a conclusion about the\n",
    "broader population from which it is taken is referred to as **statistical inference**."

    "*Why all this emphasis on sampling distributions?*\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous section that we could compute a **point estimate** of a\n",
    "population parameter using a sample of observations from the population. And\n",
    "since we constructed examples where we had access to the population, we could\n",
    "evaluate how accurate the estimate was, and even get a sense of how much the\n",
    "estimate would vary for different samples from the population.  But in real\n",
    "data analysis settings, we usually have *just one sample* from our population\n",
    "and do not have access to the population itself. Therefore we cannot construct\n",
    "the sampling distribution as we did in the previous section. And as we saw, our\n",
    "sample estimate's value can vary significantly from the population parameter.\n",
    "So reporting the point estimate from a single sample alone may not be enough.\n",
    "*We also need to report some notion of *uncertainty* in the value of the point\n",
    "estimate.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we cannot construct the exact sampling distribution without\n",
    "full access to the population. However, if we could somehow *approximate* what\n",
    "the sampling distribution would look like for a sample, we could\n",
    "use that approximation to then report how uncertain our sample\n",
    "point estimate is (as we did above with the *exact* sampling\n",
    "distribution). There are several methods to accomplish this; in this book, we\n",
    "will use the *bootstrap*. We will discuss **interval estimation** and\n",
    "construct\n",
    "**confidence intervals** using just a single sample from a population. A\n",
    "confidence interval is a range of plausible values for our population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key idea. First, if you take a big enough sample, it *looks like*\n",
    "the population. Notice the histograms' shapes for samples of different sizes\n",
    "taken from the population in the figure below. We\n",
